    <h2>I have liked programming and working with code since quite a yoing age; the earliest I remember was in late elementary when I would thoroughly enjoying hour of code and even offering to assist my classmates.
    Since then I have been pretty much set on what I enjoyed to do and my love for programming only grew when I explored it further.
    I knew I couldn't slack around if I wanted to achieve my dream job and so I have always been pretty studious kid, staying on A/B honor roll throughout K-8, and still currently have a cumulative GPA of 4.3 in high school.
    This studious behavior opened my opportunities as I was able to take the classes I would like to and I am not certified in Python and Java. I have also had a large passion for video games throughout my childhood which has crossed path with my love for development and I hope to one day make my own game.
